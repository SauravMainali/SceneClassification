Scene Classification

This project is mainly about image classification. Our group is going to classify Scenes around the globe into one of six possible classes using Deep Neural Networks. The application of scene classification could range from organization of photos in Smartphones, assist in growth of countryâ€™s economy through Tourism Planning and so on.

Our dataset is the intel image classification from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) 
There are 25,000 images in total, and 17,000 of them are labelled into the 6 categories, including Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea and Street. We are going to train models by using images in the training set and predict the categories of images in the prediction set.

We applied both self-trained model and pre-trained model to this project.The performance of all these models are compared and analyzed. Data Augmentation is applied to pre-trained models. Results before and after data augmentation are compared. We did prediction to the best models we have to see how them work. Confusion Matrix is also considered in our study.
